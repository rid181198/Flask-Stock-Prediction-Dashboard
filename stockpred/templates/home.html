            Hello, this is a project I have done to implement Long Short Term Memory 
            Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) model on the stock price data of the company.
            This model is trained on the closing price of the company and future prediction is evaluated through
            both in-built model and user-friendly model. This project also allows you for the long prediction. 
            The financial stock data is derived from Yahoo web server. You can directly use our real time stock prediction
            dashboard or you could register first and login into your profile. The benefit of login into you account is that
            you can save your predicted data and save the model for future monitor. To start the real time monitor of your prefer company, please click on the below button.
